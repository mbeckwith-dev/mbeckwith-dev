# ðŸ‘¾ Matthew Beckwith ðŸ‘¾

I fell in love with Programming in 2002 in a High School Web Development class.  Ever since, I have done whatever I can to learn and grow as a Developer.  All self taught minus the tip of the iceberg I received in that class.  My wheel house is mostly in Frontend Web Development, however I love to build standalone programs in Python and Java as well.  I have dabbled in Game Development also and like to do that in spare time, less focused on making games for release but more to solidify development and programming practices and like I said in the begining...to become a better Developer.
